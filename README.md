# 🛎️ Suitely

A modern, open-source hotel management system built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**.

Manage reservations, check-in/check-out, housekeeping, guest folios, and staff schedules for boutique hotels and larger properties.

## Features ✨

- **📅 Reservation Management** - Create, view, and manage guest bookings via a step-by-step booking wizard
- **✅ Check-In / Check-Out Workflows** - Multi-step wizards from every entry point (Reservations, Dashboard, or the navbar): occupancy + optional guest ID capture at check-in (with an automatic over-capacity surcharge), and departure date + item charges + early-checkout credit at check-out
- **🧾 Itemized Guest Folios** - Room charge plus itemized incidentals (minibar, damage, discounts) from a staff-managed items catalog, with a one-click printable receipt
- **🧹 Housekeeping & Maintenance** - A cleaning queue for turning rooms around after checkout, and a maintenance issue tracker that automatically takes a room out of service and hands it back
- **🏠 Room Management** - Track room types (incl. per-night extra-guest fees), availability, and status
- **👥 Staff Management** - Manage team members and work schedules
- **🔐 Real Auth** - Supabase Auth logins for hotel admins and individual staff members
- **📜 Rich Audit Trail** - Every reservation and folio-charge change is logged with a human-readable description (who, what, when) — survives even after the record is deleted, with a calendar-based date filter
- **📊 Dashboard** - Live room status, today's arrivals/departures (actionable, not just informational), revenue snapshot, staff on shift
- **🔒 Multi-Tenant** - Support multiple hotels with one codebase, isolated via Row-Level Security
- **🌙 Dark Mode** - Dark theme throughout, with subtle animations
- **📱 Installable (PWA)** - Add to your phone's home screen and run it full-screen like a native app — no app store, works on Android & iOS

## Quick Start 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account (free tier available at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))

### Installation

1. **Clone & Install**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set Up Supabase**
   - Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Copy Project URL, Anon Key, and **service role key** from Settings → API
   - In Authentication settings: turn **on** "Allow new users to sign up" and turn **off** "Confirm email" (Phase 1 has no email service)

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

4. **Initialize Database**
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor
   - Create new query
   - Copy all content from `database.sql`
   - Run it
   - **Resuming an existing project?** Check [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#outstanding-manual-steps-run-this-next) — not every section of `database.sql` may have been run against your project yet, and re-running the whole file isn't safe (it isn't fully idempotent).

5. **Start Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), then go to `/setup` to create your hotel admin login and first hotel.

## Usage Example

### Create a Reservation

```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'

const orgId = localStorage.getItem('orgId')

await supabase
  .from('reservations')
  .insert([{
    org_id: orgId,
    room_id: '...',
    guest_name: 'John Doe',
    guest_email: 'john@example.com',
    check_in_date: '2026-07-15',
    check_out_date: '2026-07-18',
    total_price: 300,
    status: 'confirmed'
  }])
```

Creating this reservation while signed in is automatically recorded in the audit trail (via a database trigger) — no extra code required. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for more examples.

## Roadmap 🗺️

## Deployment 🌐

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard (including `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, kept server-only)
4. Deploy!

**Free tier:**
- Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
- Supabase: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth/month

### Other Hosting Options
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Self-hosted on any VPS

### Install on Your Phone 📱

Suitely is a **Progressive Web App**, so staff can install it to the home screen and run it full-screen — no app store needed. Requires HTTPS (Vercel provides it automatically; `localhost` also works in dev).

- **Android (Chrome):** open the site → tap the **Install app** prompt, or menu (⋮) → **Add to Home screen**.
- **iOS (Safari):** open the site → **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**. (Must be Safari — iOS never auto-prompts.)

The app icon lives in `public/icons/` (currently a placeholder — swap the PNGs at the same sizes to rebrand). No code change required.

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `organizations` | Hotel info (tenants) |
| `users` | Staff members (real Supabase Auth logins) |
| `rooms` | Physical rooms |
| `room_types` | Room classifications, incl. per-night extra-guest fee |
| `reservations` | Guest bookings, incl. occupancy count and lead guest ID |
| `reservation_charges` | Itemized folio charges (services, discounts, surcharges) |
| `reservation_guests` | Additional occupants beyond the lead guest, with ID |
| `items` | Staff-managed priced catalog for quick folio charges |
| `audit_logs` | Create/update/delete trail (reservations + folio charges) |
| `staff_schedules` | Work shifts |
| `maintenance_logs` | Maintenance tracking |

All tables include Row-Level Security scoped to the authenticated user's organization (not yet scoped by staff role — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#known-limitations-phase-2-honestly-assessed)).
